QUESTION: Observe what you see with the agent's behavior as \
it takes random actions. Does the smartcab eventually make \
it to the destination? Are there any other interesting \
observations to note?

QUESTION: What states have you identified that are \
appropriate for modeling the smartcab and environment? \
Why do you believe each of these states to be appropriate \
for this problem?

OPTIONAL: How many states in total exist for the smartcab \
in this environment? Does this number seem reasonable given \
that the goal of Q-Learning is to learn and make informed \
decisions about each state? Why or why not?

QUESTION: What changes do you notice in the agent's \
behavior when compared to the basic driving agent when \
random actions were always taken? Why is this behavior \
occurring?

QUESTION: Report the different values for the parameters \
tuned in your basic implementation of Q-Learning. For \
which set of parameters does the agent perform best? How \
well does the final driving agent perform?

QUESTION: Does your agent get close to finding an optimal \
policy, i.e. reach the destination in the minimum possible \
time, and not incur any penalties? How would you describe an \
optimal policy for this problem?
